- [x] Fix the timezone problem, I'm hard coding it for now, but maybe in the future add an option for the user to prompt his timezone of whatever.
- [x] Prev sessions should look for the most recent session in the program block, and if not found, should look globally in the database.
- [x] Bodyweight exercise support, a flag in `edit-set` that goes like `-bw`.
- [x] Easy session history:
  - [x] Calendar of days trained.
  - [x] Look for a session in specific and display it (Search by ID).
  - [x] Look for a session by it's date (put a flag inside `look-session`)
  - [x] Look for overall history of sessions -> All programs, per program, per day of program.
- [x] Some silly meta data, some command like `status`, which shows info like total weight lifted, number of sessions, hours at the gym, week streak?
- [x] Setup dev env with local db with sqlite3.
- [x] Print numbers for exercise order in `show-session`.
- [ ] Be able to record sessions with specific dates (a command like `record-session` -- This should take again some sort of file).

- [x] Add `add-set` to add a new set to a given exercise during a session (also no target).
- [x] Change `edit-set` behavior, it should only accept the exercise index, weight and reps. with the set being an additional flag if needed.
