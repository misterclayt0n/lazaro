## New API for lazarus
In this example here, both session start and ss would refer to the same command, just some aliases

- [x] session start <program> <block> [<week>] == ss
- [x] session show == sh
- [x] session cancel == sc
- [x] session add-ex <exercise> <sets> [<reps>] == sae
- [x] session edit <idx> <weight> <reps> [--bw] == ses
- [x] session swap <idx> <variation> == sse
- session note <idx> <note> == ssn
- session history <program> <block> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
- [x] session end == se
- status --week --month --lifetime -> Default to week btw
- [x] exercise add <name> <muscle> [--desc TXT]
- [x] exercise import <file.toml>
- [x] exercise list --muscle
- exercise show <muscle_idx> || <muscle_name>
- [x] program import <file.toml> -> This not only creates a new program, but also updates it
- [x] program delete <file.toml> --name [<program_name>] -> Can delete by file or name
- [x] program list
- [x] program show <program_name> || <program_id>
- calendar [<YYYY-MM>] [--details]
- db export [file] -> exports to a simple file output
- db import <dump.toml> -> This syncs the current db with the provided dump.toml, and if no dump.toml is provided, it creates a new database for you

## General stuff
- [x] Config file: change aliases.
- Sync: something easy to sync with github.
- Data science: progression on exercises (strength).
- [x] Show session should grab the last occurrence of an exercise, currently it shows First time if I skipped a given ex.
- [x] Start program should look for an ID for the program name and session. see task warrior for reference. 
- [x] On the note above, all things should probably work with structured data.
- Release with cargo install or pkg for easy setup.
- [x] Option to output data as json for structured data (nushell shit).
- [x] `ex list chest` if I want to grab all chest exercises.
- Add neck as muscle.
- [x] Global indeces for exercises/programs/sets/whatever (this way it's easier to use them in a phone)

## Notes
- Aliases: donâ€™t mix a top-level alias with a built-in ex/s token.
- Nushell does not automatically recognizes json output from lazaro, we'd have to keep using `| from json` everywhere. In the future, create a small wrapper to add in nushell for this (when I make the release).
- Structured data is a must.
